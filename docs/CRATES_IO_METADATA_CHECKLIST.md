## Publishing Decision

### Can we publish now?

**YES** ✅ - All mandatory fields are present

### Should we add recommended fields?

**YES** ✅ - Recommended for better discoverability

**Benefits of adding keywords/categories**:
- Better search results on crates.io
- Easier for developers to find relevant crates
- Professional appearance
- Following Rust community best practices

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Publish Now (Minimum Viable)

```bash
# All mandatory fields present, can publish immediately
cd crates/miyabi-types && cargo publish
cd ../miyabi-core && cargo publish
# ... continue for all crates
```

**Pros**: Fast, can add metadata later in 1.0.1
**Cons**: Less discoverable, unprofessional appearance

### Option 2: Add Recommended Fields First (RECOMMENDED) ✅

```bash
# Add keywords, categories, readme to all Cargo.toml
# Then publish with complete metadata
```

**Pros**: Professional, better discoverability, complete metadata
**Cons**: 10-15 minutes more work

---

## Recommendation

**Add recommended fields before publishing** (Option 2)

**Rationale**:
- First impressions matter
- Can't change keywords easily after publish
- Only 10-15 minutes of work
- Significantly improves discoverability
- Shows professional quality

**Next Action**: Add keywords, categories, and readme to all 6 Cargo.toml files

---

**Checklist Status**: ✅ **READY (with recommended additions)**
**Estimated Time to Publish**: 15 minutes (with additions) or 5 minutes (without)
**Recommendation**: **Add recommended fields, then publish**
