Hello developers!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, I'll introduce "Miyabi" -
a framework that automates everything

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
from Issue creation to PR completion.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Miyabi has 21 specialized AI Agents
working together

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to write code, run tests, and create
Pull Requests while you sleep.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's simple to use.
Just two commands to start Miyabi.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
First, set your GitHub token
as an environment variable.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then, run "miyabi work-on"
with an issue number.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The Coordinator automatically
breaks down tasks

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and assigns them to specialist agents.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's see it in action.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Issue #270 is
"Enable TypeScript strict mode".

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
First, Coordinator analyzes the issue.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Next, CodeGen generates the code.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Reviewer checks the quality.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Finally, PR Agent creates
a Pull Request.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You don't need to do anything.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All agents work together automatically.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Miyabi has 21 specialized agents.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
