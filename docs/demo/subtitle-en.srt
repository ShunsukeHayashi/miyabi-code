Hello developers!
Are you tired of daily issue management?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Miyabi is a fully autonomous development framework
that automatically writes code, runs tests,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and creates Pull Requests -
just by creating a GitHub Issue.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today, I'll show you the power of Miyabi
in just 3 minutes.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Installation is incredibly simple.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
First, install Rust.
Then, clone Miyabi,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and run cargo build.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's it! 21 specialized agents
join your development team.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's see it in action.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We create Issue #270:
"Enable TypeScript strict mode"

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then, we run just one command:
miyabi work-on 270

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Four specialized agents
start working in sequence.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
First, "Coordinator" decomposes the task.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then, "CodeGen" implements the code.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Next, "Review" checks the quality.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Finally, "PR" creates the Pull Request.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In just 10 minutes,
a review-ready PR is complete.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Miyabi includes 21 unique
specialized agents.
