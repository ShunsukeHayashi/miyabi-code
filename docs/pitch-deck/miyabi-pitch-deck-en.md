# Companies Are Drowning in AI Tools

**Imagine this morning at your company:**

- 10 different AI tools
- Data scattered across 5 clouds
- Nobody sees the full picture
- $50M/year wasted on integration

**This is the reality.**

# $120 Billion Flowing Out

**By 2035, Japanese enterprises will pay**
**$120 billion to foreign AI vendors.**

That's <span class="emphasis">$329 million per day</span>
flowing to Silicon Valley.

**But there's a more shocking truth.**

# The Japanese Paradox

**AI Adoption: Only 9%**
1/3 of USA, 1/4 of China

**But...**

**Conversion Rate: World's Highest**
Once they start, they pay.

> "Japanese pay for real value."
> "And 1 billion Asians share the same DNA."
