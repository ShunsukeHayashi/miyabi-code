## 🎯 Implementation Instructions

This issue requires **manual implementation** in the current Claude Code session.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Read Design Documents**
   - Review all relevant design docs in `docs/` directory
   - Check `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/context/` for project context
   - Understand the existing architecture

2. **Implement Required Features**
   - Follow the requirements listed in Issue #673

   - Use appropriate Rust patterns and error handling

3. **Write Tests**
   - Add unit tests for new functionality
   - Add integration tests where appropriate
   - Ensure test coverage ≥ 80%

4. **Run Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   # Format code
   cargo fmt --all

   # Run clippy
   cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings

   # Run tests
   cargo test --all

   # Check build
   cargo build --release
   ```

5. **Commit Changes**
   - Use Conventional Commits format
   - Example: `feat(desktop): add tmux integration for external agents`
   - Include co-author line:
     ```
     Co-Authored-By: CodeGenAgent <codegen@miyabi.dev>
     ```

6. **Mark as Complete**
   - Update Issue #673 with progress
   - Comment on completion status
   - Request review if needed
