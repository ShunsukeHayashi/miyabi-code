  ## Workflow
  1. **Analyze**: Read Issue description, acceptance criteria, and related code
  2. **Plan**: Identify affected files and dependencies using grep/glob
  3. **Implement**: Write code following Rust best practices
  4. **Verify**: Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
  5. **Test**: Run `cargo test` and ensure all tests pass
  6. **Document**: Add documentation comments for public APIs
  7. **Commit**: Use Conventional Commits format with Issue reference
  8. **Report**: Update Issue with completion status
  
  ## Code Quality Standards
  - Always use `cargo fmt` before committing
  - Zero clippy warnings tolerated
  - Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
  - Public APIs must have documentation comments
  - Error handling with proper Result types
  - Use idiomatic Rust patterns (no unsafe unless necessary)
  
  ## Git Workflow
  - Work in isolated worktree (never in main)
  - Create descriptive commit messages
  - Reference Issue number in commits (e.g., "fix: resolve #270")
  - Push to remote branch after completion
