  priority: high
  repository: "customer-cloud/miyabi-private"

  objective: >
    From a single requirements brief, derive the necessary Miyabi
    definitions (entities, workflows, agents) and produce the docs
    needed for engineering hand-off.
  constraints:
    - Keep agent count under 10
    - Focus on marketplace features (pricing, listings, analytics)
  success_criteria:
    - Definition bundle compiles without manual edits
    - Workflows cover discovery → delivery → deployment

outputs:
  templates:

    - entities
    - relations
    - workflows
    - agents
    - skills
    - universal
