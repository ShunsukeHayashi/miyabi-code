By sending message cards to users, various types of application notifications and alerts can be aggregated in Lark. For example, it can integrate with existing business systems in an enterprise to send monitoring alerts, reminders for to-do tasks, company event notifications, daily data reports, stock alerts, and more.Message cards are a type of message that can contain rich text content and interactive functions. With message cards, you can:Use the rich text styles and graphic layout modules provided by message cards to send visually appealing cards, such as eye-catching notifications and articles with images, ensuring important information reaches users effectively.Use the interactive components provided by message cards to allow users to perform system operations such as approval, voting, and alert handling directly in the chat session without leaving Lark.\n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                     \n                                                     \n                                                     \n                                                   \n                                                 \n                                             \n  \n\n\n                                             \n  \n\n\n                                           Fullscreen\n                                        Exit fullscreen\n                                      \n  \n\n\n                                      \n  \n\n\n                                     Play\n                                        Pause00:00\n                                           00:00\n                                         \n  \n  \n\n\n                                         \n  \n  \n\n\n                                         \n  \n  \n\n\n                                       \n                                       \n                                         \n                                           \n                                         \n                                       2x1.5x1x0.75x0.5x1xPop-out\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n                                      \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n                                         Replay\n                                        To help developers visualize the completion of message cards, we provide a Message Card Builder tool. It allows for easy drag-and-drop addition of module components, providing a smooth experience. The tool also offers a rich library of card templates, including templates for various scenarios, enabling one-click activation for convenient and efficient use.Rich open capabilities and components that support diverse integration needs of enterprisesEnterprises can call multiple Lark module capabilities, including Lark Docs, multidimensional spreadsheets, address books, messages, tasks, user cards, and more, in their existing systems and new applications. The opened and supported capabilities can be found in the \"Open Capability List\" on the Open Platform official website.In addition to the extensive server API, Lark also provides the ability to develop various types of applications to suit customized needs.An Lark application is a carrier for developers to provide services to their users. It is usually presented in the form of bots, webapps, gadgets, etc. It also has access to the full scope of the platform, paving the way for more enhanced, custom, and powerful experiences within Lark. Some tips on makeing the choices:Bots: interact with users in chat, retrieve data, send/respond to messages, access Lark OpenAPIsWebapp : frequent content updates, existing h5 app migrationGadgets/miniapp: complex modules, require phone/Lark functions, native and smooth user experienceThe various applications commonly seen in the Workbench are Lark gadgets or Lark web applications, such as approval, and Lark Help Center.

If you want to call the API, you must get the scope to call the interface first. If it involves accessing sensitive fields, you also need to get the scope to access sensitive fields.(Optional) Configure data permissions. When an app requests permissions for certain APIs (e.g.,  Contacts, Lark HR Enterprise Edition), it needs to configure the corresponding data permissions and submit them for review. The permissions take effect after the review is approved, enabling successful data retrieval through API calls. Otherwise, an authorization error will be returned when invoking the API.(Optional) Set IP whitelist. To enhance app security, you can set an IP whitelist for your app. Only requests originating from whitelisted IP addresses will be responded to by the Lark Open Platform. Otherwise, the requests will be rejected.Call the API. After completing the above steps, you can call the open API. Users can refer to the API documentation to understand the specific functions of the API.FeedbackPrevious:Message ShortcutsNext:Obtain access tokensNeed help with a problem?Submit feedback",

The features of the MCP Tool are as follows:Provides a simple and easy-to-use command line interface for quick configuration and startup.Supports various configuration methods, adapting to different usage scenarios.Seamlessly integrates with mainstream AI tools (such as Trae, Cursor, Claude).After configuring the application information, the application access credentials can be obtained automatically; after logging into the MCP and completing user authentication, the user access credentials can be obtained automatically, with support for automatic refresh.Typical use casesAI will plan based on the actual input prompt and invoke different OpenAPIs, so the permissions that the application needs to open may vary.Scenario ExamplePre-ConfigurationTrae Running ExampleInitialize Project Management Base appsApplication Capability: BotApplication Permissions:  View, comment, edit and manage Base appsCreate Group Chat, Add Members and Send Lark CardApplication Capability: BotApplication Permissions:Retrieve and update group informationSend messages as an applicationOthers: Ensure all members in the group are within the application's visibility scope.

You can also determine if an API is supported within the MCP Tool through the API documentation. For example, open an API development document, such as Send Message. If there is a \"Try it out\" button, it indicates that the API is available within the MCP Tool.APIs in grayscale (i.e., APIs marked as Limited access at the beginning of the API documentation) are temporarily not supported in the MCP tool.APIs related to image or file upload/download are temporarily not supported within the MCP tool.MCP tool naming schemeThe MCP Tool follows the naming scheme of biz.version.resource.method, consistent with the method naming of the server-side Node SDK. You can obtain the name of an OpenAPI in the MCP Tool in the following way:In the API documentation, click Try it out and check the Node SDK sample code. The function after the client method is the name of the API in the MCP Tool. For example, as shown in the figure below, the name of the Send Message API is im.v1.message.create.FeedbackPrevious:requestAuthCodeNext:Develop OpenAPI MCP smart assistantNeed help with a problem?Submit feedback",
