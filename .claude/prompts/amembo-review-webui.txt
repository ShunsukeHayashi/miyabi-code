# Task

Review the Miyabi WebUI MVP that was just created and provide comprehensive feedback for the next iteration.

# Context

**What was created**:
1. Web UI Dashboard (`web-ui/`)
   - HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
   - Node.js/Express backend API
   - Task submission form
   - Real-time status dashboard
   - Task detail modal
   - Log viewer

2. Features:
   - Task submission with template selection
   - Status visualization (Pending/In Progress/Completed/Blocked)
   - GitHub Issue/PR integration display
   - Auto-refresh (5s intervals)
   - Filtering by status

**User Requirements**:
- ユーザーはGitHub + WebUI + Pendantだけ見ればOK
- タスク投入 → 処理状況確認 → 結果確認
- すぐ使える（MVP）

**New Requirements** (just added):
1. **File Management System** needed
   - Per-tenant/user directory structure
   - File tree management
   - **GitHub Remote Only** (no local files if possible)
   - Remote-first architecture

# Review Process (6 Phases)

## Θ1: Understand (理解)

Analyze the current WebUI MVP:
- What works well?
- What's missing?
- Does it meet user requirements?
- Is the architecture sound?

## Θ2: Generate (生成)

Identify improvements needed:
- Missing features
- UX/UI enhancements
- Architecture gaps
- Integration points

## Θ3: Allocate (配分)

Prioritize feedback:
- P0: Critical (blocks MVP)
- P1: High (needed for v1.0)
- P2: Medium (nice to have)
- P3: Low (future)

## Θ4: Execute (実行)

Provide detailed recommendations:
- Specific actionable items
- Code examples if helpful
- Architecture diagrams
- User flow improvements

## Θ5: Integrate (統合)

Synthesize into action plan:
- Next iteration tasks
- Implementation order
- Estimated effort
- Dependencies

## Θ6: Learn (学習)

Document learnings:
- What went well in MVP creation
- What could be improved in process
- Reusable patterns identified
- Best practices
