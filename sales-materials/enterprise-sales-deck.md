## Slide 1: Executive Summary

### Transform Your Enterprise with Production-Ready AI Agents

**The Problem**: 73% of enterprise AI projects fail to reach production due to unreliable frameworks and demo-focused solutions.

**The Solution**: Miyabi AI Agent Framework - the first enterprise-grade platform built for production from day one.

**The Opportunity**: Join 1000+ developers already deploying reliable AI agents at scale.

---

## Slide 2: The Enterprise AI Reality Gap

### Current State of Enterprise AI Development

**What Most AI Frameworks Promise:**
- ✨ Impressive demos and prototypes
- 🚀 "Revolutionary" capabilities
- 💡 Quick proof-of-concepts

**What Enterprises Actually Get:**
- ❌ 73% failure rate in production deployment
- ⏰ 18+ month implementation cycles
- 💸 $2.4M average cost of failed AI projects
- 🔒 Security and compliance nightmares

### The Production Reality Check

> "We spent 14 months and $3.2M building AI agents with [competitor]. They worked beautifully in demos but failed catastrophically in production."
> — CTO, Fortune 500 Financial Services Company

## Slide 3: Why Traditional AI Frameworks Fail in Production

### The Four Critical Gaps

#### 1. **Demo vs. Production Gap**
- Built for showcases, not real workloads
- No enterprise security considerations
- Fragile under actual business conditions

#### 2. **Scale vs. Reliability Gap**
- Works with sample data, breaks with real volumes
- No proper error handling or recovery
- Unpredictable performance under load

#### 3. **Complexity vs. Maintainability Gap**
- Over-engineered for simple use cases
- No clear upgrade or rollback paths
- Technical debt accumulates rapidly

#### 4. **Promise vs. Reality Gap**
- Vendor lock-in with proprietary APIs
- Hidden costs and licensing surprises
- Limited enterprise support and SLAs
